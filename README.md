# Context

Standard simple blog site with features that hide comments and ratings on posts until a user comments or rates a post. 

### Problem

Many people on the internet tend to unconsiously form opinions influenced by the majority. They might read through the comments on a post and subconsciously determine that the majority opinion has to be right and simply add to the general sentiment. Rob Henderson in his article [The Science Behind Why People Follow the Crowd](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/after-service/201705/the-science-behind-why-people-follow-the-crowd) refers to this bias as the "principle of social proof", a term coined as one of Dr. Robert Cialdini's six principles of persuasion in his book *Influence*.

### Solution

Hiding comments and ratings until the user interacts with the post will allow for more genuine reactions to the content of the post by eliminating the social bias.
